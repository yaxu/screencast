castavi.sh - records screencast, with audio from jack, to an uncompressed 
             avi file
screensave - records screencast with audio from jack, and webcam to another 
             file, both uncompressed
screencast - a wacky thing sending screencast with alsa audio to an icecast
             server, taking various OSC messages to write text to different
             parts of the screen.  What I used for this:
                http://www.archive.org/details/yaxu2008-12-13.sofa-coding
tailosc.pl - sends contents of a file to screencast above, to go in the
             subtitles area. I used this with irc log file to put chat
             messages in the stream
quad.sh    - mixes four videos into a split screen webm
Makefile   - makefile for screensave and screencast

All rely on various bits of gstreamer, castavi.sh needs gst-launch and
the others need libgstreamer0.10-dev or similar, plus install all the 
plugins for luck.  Also liblo-dev
